Ola Driver Attrition Prediction:

In this project, I utilized Python libraries to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), revealing higher churn rates among drivers who experienced no income growth or rating improvement. 

I addressed missing data using KNN imputation and tackled the challenges of an imbalanced dataset with SMOTE. I built and optimized Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers 
using Scikit-learn, employing hyperparameter tuning to achieve a high prediction accuracy with an F1 score and AUC of 88%. 

The analysis identified key factors contributing to driver churn, such as income, quarterly ratings, driver grade, and education level, which informed targeted and impactful retention strategies
